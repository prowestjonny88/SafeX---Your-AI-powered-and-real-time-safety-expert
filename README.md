## 🔍 Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Scam losses in Malaysia reached **RM3.18 billion** between 2021–2023, with over **95,800 cases** reported in 2023 alone. Globally, consumers lost over **$10 billion** to fraud in 2023. Scammers don't succeed because victims are careless — they succeed because they exploit fundamental human psychology:

- **Urgency** — "Act now or your account will be locked"
- **Authority** — Impersonating banks, police, or delivery companies
- **Fear & Shame** — "Your account is compromised"
- **Greed** — "Guaranteed 300% investment returns"
- **Isolation** — "Don't tell anyone about this"

By the time a victim realizes they are being scammed, they are already emotionally controlled. **There is no tool that intervenes at the moment of manipulation** — before the victim clicks, transfers money, or shares credentials.

### Our Solution

**SafeX** is an AI-powered Android companion app that intercepts scam attempts **at the point of emotional manipulation** — before the user acts. It runs silently in the background, monitors incoming notifications and gallery images for scam indicators, and delivers **instant, calm, easy-to-understand warnings** with clear next steps.

Unlike traditional anti-virus or SMS blockers that rely on known blacklists, SafeX uses a **hybrid on-device + cloud AI pipeline** to detect scam *intent* — the psychological manipulation patterns that are common across all scam types, regardless of language (English, Malay, Chinese).

### SDG Alignment

| SDG | Target | How SafeX Contributes |
|-----|--------|----------------------|
| **SDG 16 — Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions** | **16.4** — Significantly reduce illicit financial flows | SafeX directly combats financial fraud by detecting and preventing scam attempts before money is lost, reducing the flow of funds to criminal scam syndicates. |
| **SDG 16** | **16.a** — Strengthen relevant national institutions for preventing crime | SafeX's scam news awareness feed educates users on emerging scam patterns, building a more informed and resilient society against fraud. |
| **SDG 10 — Reduced Inequalities** | **10.2** — Empower and promote social inclusion | SafeX specifically protects vulnerable populations — elders, non-tech-savvy users, and non-English speakers — through multi-language support (EN/MS/ZH), elder-friendly language, and proactive Guardian mode that requires zero user effort. |

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🛡️ Guardian Mode — Real-Time Background Protection

SafeX can run in **Guardian mode**, silently monitoring incoming content without any user effort:

- **Notification Monitoring** — Uses Android's `NotificationListenerService` to read notification previews from WhatsApp, SMS, Telegram, and any messaging app. When a notification arrives, SafeX extracts the preview text and runs it through the **hybrid triage pipeline** (heuristic rules + TFLite AI model). If flagged as high-risk, a **warning notification is posted immediately**.
- **Gallery Monitoring** — Uses `WorkManager` to periodically scan newly saved images (screenshots, forwarded images, QR code posters). Images are processed through **ML Kit OCR** (text extraction) and **ML Kit Barcode Scanning** (QR code detection). Extracted text and URLs are then run through the same triage pipeline.

### 2. 🔍 Manual Scan — User-Initiated Scanning

Users can manually scan suspicious content from the Home tab:

- **Paste Link** — Enter any URL and SafeX sends it to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** via Firebase Cloud Functions for deep analysis. Gemini examines domain structure, TLD suspiciousness, typosquatting patterns, brand impersonation, and known phishing patterns — then returns a structured risk assessment with reasons, recommended actions, and warnings. The backend also runs a **local heuristic check** (Levenshtein distance-based typosquatting detection against 30+ Malaysian and global brands) to give Gemini additional context.
- **Pick Image** — Select an image from the gallery. SafeX uses **ML Kit Text Recognition** (OCR) and **ML Kit Barcode Scanning** (QR) to extract text and URLs, then runs them through the on-device triage engine for instant risk assessment.
- **Camera Scan** — Real-time camera scanning using **CameraX**. Scan QR codes and printed text (posters, flyers, receipts) live. Extracted content is immediately triaged.

### 3. 🧠 AI-Powered Explanation (Gemini 2.5 Flash)

When a user opens an alert, SafeX calls the `explainAlert` Cloud Function which sends the alert data to **Gemini 2.5 Flash on Vertex AI**. Gemini acts as the ultimate judge — it can override on-device scores if the text is clearly benign (e.g., legitimate OTPs, university announcements) or clearly malicious (well-disguised scams). Gemini returns:

- **Risk Level** (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
- **Scam Category** (Phishing, Investment Scam, Love Scam, Job Scam, Impersonation, etc.)
- **"Why SafeX flagged this"** — Clear bullet points explaining the manipulation tactics detected
- **"What you should do now"** — Actionable safety steps
- **"What NOT to do"** — Prevent the user from making common mistakes (e.g., "Do not share your OTP")
- **Confidence Score** — Transparency on how certain the AI is
- **Score Breakdown** — Shows the on-device heuristic (20%) and TFLite AI (80%) weighted contributions

All explanations use **calm, non-blaming, elder-friendly language**. If the network is unavailable, a **fallback generic safety advisory** is displayed — the app never crashes or shows an error.

### 4. 📰 Scam News Awareness Feed

The Insights tab features a **curated scam news feed** to increase user awareness:

- A **scheduled Cloud Function** (`periodicScamNewsScraper`) runs every hour, scraping **Google News RSS** for scam-related articles using targeted keywords (SMS scam, WhatsApp scam, fake app, smishing, job scam, love scam, investment scam, pig butchering, etc.)
- Each scraped article is sent to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for intelligent filtering — Gemini **rejects** articles about corporate fraud, B2B issues, or non-mobile scams, and only **accepts** scams targeting individuals through phones, messaging apps, social media, or calls
- Accepted articles are **re-titled and summarized** by Gemini with a concise anti-scam summary and preventative tips, then stored in **Firestore** (`scam_news` collection)
- The Android app fetches these pre-processed articles via the `getScamNewsDigest` Cloud Function and caches them locally using **Room** for offline access
- Articles include Gemini-generated **warnings and tips** specific to each scam type
- Headlines can be **translated on-device** using ML Kit Translation when the user selects a non-English language

### 5. 🌐 Multi-Language Support (EN / MS / ZH)

SafeX supports **English, Bahasa Melayu, and Simplified Chinese** — the three most spoken languages in Malaysia:

- **Full UI localization** — All tab labels, buttons, instructions, and disclaimers are translated using Android's resource configuration (`values/`, `values-ms/`, `values-zh/`)
- **On-device content translation** — Gemini analysis results and news headlines are translated in real-time using **ML Kit Translation** (no network required after initial model download)
- **Language selection** — Users choose their language during first-run onboarding, and can change it anytime in Settings. The change applies immediately across the entire app via `AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales()`

### 6. ⚙️ Flexible Operating Modes

- **Guardian Mode** (proactive) — Background monitoring of notifications and gallery. Designed for elders and vulnerable users who need protection with zero effort.
- **Companion Mode** (manual only) — No background monitoring. Users scan content manually when they want. Designed for privacy-conscious users.

## 🛠️ Google Technologies Used

### Core Google AI & Cloud

| Technology | How It's Used in SafeX |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (via Vertex AI) | The AI backbone of SafeX. Used in 3 Cloud Functions: (1) `explainAlert` — analyzes flagged messages and returns structured scam explanations; (2) `checkLink` — performs deep URL phishing analysis with domain structure, typosquatting, and brand impersonation detection; (3) `periodicScamNewsScraper` — intelligently filters and summarizes scraped scam news articles, rejecting irrelevant content. |
| **Firebase Cloud Functions** (v2, TypeScript) | Hosts 5 serverless functions in `asia-southeast1`: `explainAlert`, `checkLink`, `getScamNewsDigest`, `periodicScamNewsScraper`, `backfillHistoricalScams`. All callable functions require Firebase Auth. Scheduled function runs hourly for news aggregation. |
| **Firebase Authentication** (Anonymous) | Every device gets an anonymous auth token automatically. This secures all callable Cloud Functions without requiring user signup — critical for reducing friction for elder users. |
| **Cloud Firestore** | Stores the `scam_news` collection — pre-processed, Gemini-verified scam news articles with titles, summaries, warnings/tips, source URLs, and timestamps. Indexed by `createdAt` for efficient retrieval. |
| **Google Cloud Vertex AI API** | Provides the Gemini 2.5 Flash model endpoint. Cloud Functions authenticate via the service account's default credentials — no API key needed in code. |

### On-Device Google AI (ML Kit)

| Technology | How It's Used in SafeX |
|------------|----------------------|
| **ML Kit Text Recognition** (OCR) | Extracts text from images during gallery scanning (Guardian mode) and manual image/camera scanning. Supports English and Chinese text recognition (`text-recognition` + `text-recognition-chinese`). |
| **ML Kit Barcode Scanning** | Detects and decodes QR codes from images and camera feed. Extracted URLs are triaged through the scam detection pipeline. |
| **ML Kit Language Identification** | Identifies the language of incoming notification text (EN/MS/ZH/other) to select appropriate heuristic pattern sets for scam detection. |
| **ML Kit Translation** | Translates Gemini analysis results and news headlines into the user's selected language entirely **on-device** — no network call needed after the translation model is downloaded. Supports EN ↔ MS ↔ ZH. |

### On-Device ML (TensorFlow Lite)

| Technology | How It's Used in SafeX |
|------------|----------------------|
| **TensorFlow Lite** (Interpreter) | Runs the custom **Char-CNN scam detection model** on-device. The model takes raw text as character-level integer IDs (`int32[1, 512]`) and outputs a scam probability (`float32[1, 1]`). Inference runs in < 50ms on mid-range devices. |
| **Custom Char-CNN Model** | A character-level convolutional neural network trained on EN/MS/ZH scam datasets (collected from Kaggle and curated sources). Trained in Google Colab, exported as `safex_charcnn_dynamic.tflite` (428KB). Uses a 5000-token character vocabulary with NFKC normalization, URL/number masking, and sequence padding to 512 characters. |

### Other Google Technologies

| Technology | How It's Used in SafeX |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Android Jetpack Compose** | Entire UI is built with Compose + Material 3. Modern, declarative UI with theme customization (SafeX Blue theme). |
| **Android CameraX** | Powers the real-time camera scan feature. Provides lifecycle-aware camera preview and image analysis pipeline for QR/OCR scanning. |
| **Android WorkManager** | Schedules gallery monitoring scans responsibly. Runs background image processing without draining battery. |
| **Android Room** | Local SQLite database for alert storage (`AlertEntity`) and news article caching (`NewsArticleEntity`). Provides offline-first experience — all alerts and cached news are available without internet. |
| **Android DataStore** (Preferences) | Persists user preferences: language selection, operating mode (Guardian/Companion), notification/gallery toggle states, onboarding completion status. |
| **AndroidX Navigation Compose** | Handles 4-tab bottom navigation (Home, Alerts, Insights, Settings) and screen routing (alert detail, scan screens, onboarding). |
| **Google News RSS** | Public news feed used as source for scam news aggregation. Queried by the scheduled Cloud Function with targeted scam keywords. |

### Detection Pipeline — How SafeX Catches Scams

SafeX uses a **3-level hybrid detection system** that combines speed (on-device) with intelligence (cloud AI):

**Level 1 — Heuristic Rules Engine (20% weight)**
A pattern-matching engine that detects scam indicators across EN/MS/ZH:
- **Urgency + Money** compound signals (e.g., "segera" + "RM", "urgent" + "transfer")
- **Impersonation + Action** patterns (e.g., "Bank Negara" + "verify", "PDRM" + "warrant")
- **Suspicious URLs** — shortened domains, suspicious TLDs (`.xyz`, `.top`, `.club`, `.vip`)
- **Typosquatting detection** — Levenshtein distance matching against 30+ known brands (Maybank, CIMB, WhatsApp, Touch 'n Go, Shopee, Lazada, etc.)

**Level 2 — TFLite Char-CNN Model (80% weight)**
A custom character-level convolutional neural network trained on scam datasets:
- Input: Raw text → character-level integer IDs (vocab size: 5000, sequence length: 512)
- Preprocessing: NFKC normalization → URL masking (`<URL>`) → number masking (`<NUM>`)
- Output: Scam probability (0.0 to 1.0)
- Trained on EN/MS/ZH scam messages collected from Kaggle and curated sources
- Model size: 428KB — lightweight enough for any Android device

**Combined Scoring:**
```
Combined Score = (Heuristic Score × 0.20) + (TFLite Score × 0.80)
```
- Score ≥ **0.50** → Alert created + warning notification posted
- Score ≥ **0.75** → Risk labeled as HIGH
- Score ≥ **0.40** → Risk labeled as MEDIUM

**Level 3 — Gemini 2.5 Flash (Cloud, on-demand)**
When the user opens an alert, Gemini receives:
- The redacted text snippet (max 500 chars)
- On-device heuristic and TFLite scores
- Detected category and tactics

Gemini acts as the **ultimate judge** — it can downgrade false positives (legitimate OTPs, marketing, event posters) to LOW risk, or confirm true positives with detailed explanations. It also determines the specific scam category (from 13 categories: Phishing, Investment Scam, Love Scam, Job Scam, E-commerce Scam, Impersonation Scam, Loan Scam, Giveaway Scam, Tech Support Scam, Deepfake, KK Farm Scam, Spam, Other).

### Innovation Highlights

1. **Hybrid AI Pipeline** — Combining fast on-device ML (< 50ms) with powerful cloud AI (Gemini) creates a system that is both instant and intelligent. On-device triage handles 99% of decisions without any network call.

2. **False-Positive-Tolerant Design** — We deliberately tuned the on-device threshold to **favor detection over precision**. It's better to warn a user about a potential scam that turns out to be safe, than to miss a real scam. Gemini then acts as the second opinion to filter out false positives when the user reviews the alert.

3. **Privacy-First Architecture** — No raw conversations, images, or full URLs ever leave the device by default. Gemini only receives redacted snippets (max 500 chars) when the user explicitly opens an alert. No personal data is stored in the cloud.

4. **Scam News Intelligence Pipeline** — Rather than showing raw RSS feeds, every news article passes through Gemini for relevance filtering and summarization. This ensures users only see mobile-targeted scam news with actionable tips — not corporate fraud or unrelated cybersecurity news.

5. **Multi-Script Detection** — The Char-CNN model and heuristic engine both handle English, Malay, and Chinese text natively — critical for Malaysia's multilingual population. The character-level approach means the model can handle mixed-language messages (code-switching).

## 💪 Challenges Faced

### 1. Training a Robust On-Device TFLite Model

The biggest challenge was building a TFLite model that could reliably detect scams across **three languages** (English, Malay, Chinese) while handling the enormous variety of scam patterns in the wild. Scam messages constantly evolve — new templates, new social engineering tactics, mixed-language messages — making it nearly impossible to cover every condition with maximum accuracy.

After extensive experimentation with different architectures and datasets on Google Colab and Kaggle, we adopted a **character-level CNN (Char-CNN)** approach. Unlike word-level models, Char-CNN processes raw characters, making it naturally robust to typos, mixed scripts, and character substitutions that scammers frequently use (e.g., "M@ybank" instead of "Maybank"). However, the trade-off is that the model may flag some legitimate messages as suspicious.

We made a deliberate design decision to embrace this: **we chose to prioritize recall (catching every scam) over precision (avoiding false alarms)**. Our philosophy is that it is far better to warn a user about a message that turns out to be safe, than to miss a real scam that leads to financial loss. The false-positive-tolerant on-device model acts as a safety net, while **Gemini 2.5 Flash serves as the intelligent second opinion** — when users open an alert, Gemini can accurately downgrade false positives (like legitimate bank OTPs or university announcements) while confirming real threats.

### 2. Gemini Prompt Engineering for Structured Output

Getting Gemini to consistently return valid, parseable JSON with the exact schema we needed — across different scam types, languages, and edge cases — required significant iteration. We also had to carefully engineer the system prompt to produce **calm, non-blaming, elder-friendly explanations** while being technically accurate enough to be useful.

### 3. Scam News Relevance Filtering

Scraping "scam news" from Google News RSS returns a mix of corporate fraud, political news, cybersecurity reports, and actual mobile-targeted scams. We needed Gemini to act as an intelligent filter — accepting only articles about scams that target individuals through their phones, and rejecting everything else. Getting the prompt specificity right was an iterative process.

### 4. Multi-Language Heuristic Pattern Design

Creating compound heuristic patterns that work across English, Malay, and Chinese without producing false positives on legitimate content (bank notifications, delivery updates, event posters) was surprisingly difficult. Each language has its own patterns for urgency, authority, and money references. We solved this by requiring **both sides of a compound signal to match** — for example, an urgency keyword alone doesn't trigger a flag, but urgency + money reference does.

### 5. Build Environment & Dependency Conflicts

Integrating multiple Google SDKs (Firebase, ML Kit, TFLite, CameraX, Room, Compose) in a single Android project created complex dependency conflicts — particularly KSP annotation processing for Room, CameraX native library alignment for 16KB page support, and Firebase BoM version compatibility. Additionally, OneDrive file sync caused persistent file-locking issues during Gradle builds, requiring specific workflow adjustments.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- **Multimodal Gemini Analysis** — Use Gemini's vision capabilities to directly analyze suspicious images (with explicit user consent), enabling detection of visual scam patterns like fake bank interfaces and fraudulent receipts
- **Link Gatekeeper** — Intercept link taps system-wide using Android's "Open with SafeX" intent filter, scanning URLs before they open in the browser
- **Elder Mode UI** — A simplified interface with larger fonts, higher contrast, and reduced options specifically designed for elderly users
- **Trusted Contacts** — Allow users to designate trusted contacts; messages from these contacts bypass scanning
- **Community Scam Intelligence** — Re-introduce anonymized, privacy-safe community reporting with k-anonymity thresholds to build crowdsourced scam trend data
- **iOS Version** — Expand beyond Android to reach a wider audience (within iOS platform limitations)
- **Offline Gemini** — Explore Gemini Nano for fully on-device explanations, eliminating cloud dependency entirely

## 📄 Privacy

SafeX is designed to be **privacy-first**:

- ❌ Does **NOT** read OTP codes
- ❌ Does **NOT** bypass WhatsApp encryption
- ❌ Does **NOT** read private chat history — only notification previews (what the OS exposes)
- ❌ Does **NOT** upload full conversations or images
- ❌ Does **NOT** store any personal data on the cloud
- ✅ Gemini receives only **redacted text snippets** (max 500 chars) when the user explicitly opens an alert
- ✅ All detection runs **on-device first** — cloud is only used for explanation and news
